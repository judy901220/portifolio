            <h3>
              For most ride-sharing apps, college student are rising target
              audience. However, the current apps do not completely reflect what
              college students need under the condition that they have limited
              budget. Thus, I decided to build a ride-sharing app that better
              help college students find the car they need by asking their
              preference before their ride.
            </h3>

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Roles & Responsibilities:</h2>
            <h3>User research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability test</h3>

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Project Duration:</h2>
            <h3>From Oct. 2022 to Nov. 2022</h3>

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Insights from listening sessions:</h2>
            <h3>
              Some user would like to chat with the driver, but some prefer
              quiter environment
            </h3>
            <h3>
              → The app should enable the user to inform the driver their
              preferred way of interaction without telling the driver in person.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              College students usually choose the cheapest type of car but tend
              to find out that the car does not meet her expectation after the
              car arrives
            </h3>
            <h3>
              → The app should recommend the car types based on user’s
              individual needs.
            </h3>
            <h3>Some user feel bad to express their thoughts about the ride</h3>
            <h3>
              → The app should make sure that the review session is anonymous.
            </h3>

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Competitor analysis:</h2>
            <h3>
              People from all over the globe use different ride-sharing apps.
              Therefore, I include 4 different ride-sharing apps, Uber, Lyft,
              Cabify and Gett, from different countries in my competitor
              analysis. The first two apps share many features in common. They
              provides users with detailed information about the ride and
              organize the information in a consistent way. While the other two
              apps either provides little information or present it in an
              illogical way.
            </h3>

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Persona:</h2>
            <h3>
              For most ride-sharing apps, their original target users are
              business men/women, who would like to save time by using these
              apps. Unlike those original users, college students are more
              money-sensitive. Ride-sharing apps are not for daily use. Instead,
              they usually use ride-sharing apps only when public transportation
              is not available or when there is someone else to split the bill.
              It is important to separate college users’ needs from those
              business men/women’s needs because the final design should cater
              to our specific customers’ needs.

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">User Journey:</h2>
            <h3>
              This user journey indicate the process of taking this user from
              her dorm to the closest airport. My design will focus on improving
              the stage of <b>“Select the car and request the ride”</b> and
              <b>“Arrive the destination”</b> by simplifying and clarifying the
              information that present to the users and the actions they need to
              take.

            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">Information Architecture:</h2>
            <h3>
              As the information architecture shows, the user flow is long and
              mainly linear. That is to say, users have to run through all of
              the steps to successfully reserve a ride. It is critical to
              display these big amount of information in an organized way so
              that they do not overwhelmed the users.

              Usability Testing: Plan
            </h2>
            <h3>
              For testing the functionality of this app, I choose to use 
              unmoderated usability test by sending out the google form and 
              the prototype link to some of my friend. The questions are 
              divided into four parts, including questions about 
              <b>first impression</b>, <b>task completion</b>, <b>overall reflection</b>, and 
              <b>System Usability Scale (SUS)</b>.
              Here are some of my sample questions:
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “Without clicking anything, please scan through the first page 
              and briefly share your initial thoughts/feelings about what you see.”
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “When you navigate to “Choose your pickup” page, try to select a better 
              pickup spot according to the suggestion of the app. Do you feel the 
              information on this page helpful? If not, what should be included or 
              removed to make it more helpful?”
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “What three words best describe this app?” 
            </h3>
            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">
              Usability Testing: Results
            </h2>
            <h3>
              After the first round of usability testing, I collected data from 
              four university students. Their ride-sharing experience are 
              all based on their experience in the USA. The overall SUS is 80, 
              which is above the average score 68, indicating the functionality 
              of this app is better than average. Some of the feedback in 
              open-ended questions are as follows:
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “The design looks a little plain but it is very straightforward. 
              I feel like there could be more color.”
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “The coherency and simple formatting helped make the app easier to navigate.”
            </h3>
            <h3>
              ”I don't think a user should be able to "skip" this page since the driver 
              may not allow pets in their car or only has a small vehicle and 
              cannot fit over 2 carry-ons.”
            </h3>
            <h3>
              “I think the suggested tipping is great since tipping culture varies 
              in different countries. I wonder how I, as a user, can access these 
              ratings/written comments when booking a ride though to see if I feel 
              comfortable being with a given driver?”
            </h3>
            <h2 class="blank-paragraph">
              Iteration
            </h2>
            <h3>
              My interviewees had highlighted several areas for improvement. 
              To accommodate those pain points, I redesigned some of the 
              panels with additional features.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              1. Add detailed customization options to ensure the suitability between 
              the user and the driver; eliminate the “skip” button because the 
              information on this page is necessary. For example, a driver’s car may 
              not able to accommodate more than 2 suitcases that are above 28 inch.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              2. Give more instruction on how to choose a pick-up spot and 
              what the purple illustration on the map stands for.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              3. Allow the user to see the review of the driver and 
              the opportunity to change the driver according to reviews.
            </h3>

              Looking Forwards
            </h2>
            <h3>
              If I have more time, there are some aspects that I’d like to improve 
              to make it a better ride-sharing app:
            <h3>
              • Apply secondary color to create hierarchy and a more engaging user interface
            </h3>
            <h3>
              • Add progress bar to visualize the progression because the booking process 
              may be long and stressful for users 
            </h3>
            <h3 class="end-blank">
              • Utilize more verbal instruction e.g. a pop-up notification in reduce confusion
